# testutils

I created this library while I was a TA for CS210 at UMass Boston.
It facilitates writing automated tests that score student assignments.

This project is only lightly maintained, anda tutorial does not currently exist.
However, the testutils-javadocs.jar file contains javadocs for most public methods
needed to write tests.
